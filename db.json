Pick one or a few!</h3><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Add garlic: </strong>Lightly rub a peeled raw garlic clove over the top of your toast before adding the avocado, or mix a tiny pinch of garlic powder into the avocado.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Add fresh leafy herbs or your favorite herbed sauce:</strong> Chopped fresh basil, cilantro, dill or parsley are all good with avocado. So is a drizzle of pesto, zhoug sauce (spicy cilantro sauce), or chimichurri.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Put an egg on it: </strong>I love to top my avocado toast with a fried egg for extra protein (example here). You can do a poached egg or scrambled egg if you prefer.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>More extras:</strong> Quick-pickled onions or radishes or jalapeños, your favorite hot sauce, or a sprinkle of sliced cherry tomatoes.</li></ul>",
            "recipe": "<h3>1) Pick great avocados</h3><p>You want ripe but not over-ripe Hass avocados. Look for avocados that yield a bit to a gentle squeeze, but avoid using avocados that are mushy or stringy on the inside. If you run into any bruised or brown bits when you cut them open, scoop those out and discard before mashing the rest.</p><p><br></p><h3>2) Buy good bread and toast it well</h3><p>I think sturdy, thick-sliced, whole grain bread make the best avocado toast. Golden, well-toasted bread offers a sturdy base and a crisp, shattering contrast against the creamy avocado.</p><p><br></p><h3>3) Mash your avocado separately</h3><p>Mashed avocado is more creamy and luxurious than sliced avocado (think guacamole vs. plain avocado). But don’t mash it on the toast! You risk poking holes in your toast or smashing it. Cut your avocados in half, remove the pit, scoop the flesh into a bowl or onto the side of your plate, and mash it up with a fork.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mashing a lot of avocados at once?</strong> Use a potato masher or pastry cutter instead of a measly little fork.</p><p><br></p><h3>4) Don’t forget the salt</h3><p>You’ll want to mix in at least a pinch of salt per avocado half. Bonus points? Finish your avocado toast with a light sprinkle of flaky sea salt.</p>",

Soak for 20 mins, then drain into a bowl, discarding the last few tbsp of liquid left in the bowl.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 2</strong></p><p>Crumble 1 vegetable stock cube into the mushroom liquid, then squeeze the mushrooms gently to remove any liquid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 3</strong></p><p>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a shallow saucepan or deep frying pan over a medium flame. Add 1 finely chopped onion and 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, then fry for about 5 mins until soft.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 4</strong></p><p>Stir in 250g chopped chestnut mushrooms and the dried mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and continue to cook for 8 mins until the fresh mushrooms have softened.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 5</strong></p><p>Tip 300g risotto rice into the pan and cook for 1 min. Pour over a 175ml glass of white wine and let it bubble to nothing so the alcohol evaporates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 6</strong></p><p>Keep the pan over a medium heat and pour in a quarter of the mushroom stock. Simmer the rice, stirring often, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 7</strong></p><p>Add about the same amount of stock again and continue to simmer and stir - it should start to become creamy, plump and tender. By the time the final quarter of stock is added, the rice should be almost cooked.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 8</strong></p><p>Continue stirring until the rice is cooked. If the rice is still undercooked, add a splash of water. Take the pan off the heat, add 25g butter and scatter over 25g grated parmesan or Grana Padano cheese and half a handful of chopped parsley leaves.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP 9</strong></p><p>Cover and leave for a few mins so that the rice can take up any excess liquid as it cools a bit. Give the risotto a final stir, spoon into bowls and scatter with the remaining 25g grated cheese and the remaining chopped parsley leaves.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Chefs Evan and Sarah Rich of RT Rotisserie in San Francisco make the very best chicken. They use a buttermilk brine that includes umami powder, garlic and Douglas fir—a signature ingredient from their flagship restaurant, Rich Table, that they forage themselves. In this adaptation, the chicken is roasted in the oven, and the brine is made with buttermilk, dried porcini, garlic and rosemary, though if you have access to Douglas fir sprigs, feel free to use them.</p>",
            "recipe": "<h3><strong><em>Step 1</em></strong></h3><p>In a medium saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of salt with the smashed garlic, the sugar, rosemary, bay leaf and 2 cups of water. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar. Transfer the mixture to a very large bowl and stir in 2 cups of cold water.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><em>Step 2</em></strong></h3><p>In a spice grinder, grind the mushrooms to a powder. (You should have about 3 tablespoons.) Whisk the porcini powder and buttermilk into the salt mixture. Place the chicken in the buttermilk brine, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 12 hours.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><em>Step 3</em></strong></h3><p>Preheat the oven to 425°. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry; discard the brine. Tuck the wing tips behind the breasts, tie the legs with kitchen twine and set the chicken, breast side up, in a rack over a roasting pan. Season all over with salt.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><em>Step 4</em></strong></h3><p>Roast the chicken for 15 minutes. Brush the butter all over the chicken, then return it to the oven and roast for about 45 minutes longer, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165°. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><em>Step 5</em></strong></h3><p>Meanwhile, in a small skillet, simmer the olive oil with the sliced garlic over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic just starts to brown and the oil is hot and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let cool.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong><em>Step 6</em></strong></h3><p>Carve the chicken and arrange the pieces on a platter. Brush with some of the garlic oil and serve right away, passing the remaining oil at the table.</p>",
